# BizHawk Connector

## Purpose

This script connects BizHawk to EmoTracker for use with autotracker packs. Use this instead of the version that ships with EmoTracker for improved compatibility with Archipelago and newer versions of BizHawk.

## Usage

Download and extract into BizHawk's Lua folder. Load the `Lua\bizhawk-connector\connector.lua` file into BizHawk (2.3 - 2.8) to connect to an Emotracker pack that supports autotracking. See more detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/coavins/EmoTrackerPacks#connect-to-bizhawk).

It is recommended to load this *after* other scripts like Archipelago's OOT lua.

## Compatibility

This script was tested and known to work with the following software:

* EmoTracker 2.3.8.17
* BizHawk 2.8 (x64) commit e731e0f32
* Archipelago Ocarina of Time Client 0.3.2

## Attribution
